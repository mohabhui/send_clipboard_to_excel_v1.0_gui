Application Usage Instructions

• Overview
This application allows you to monitor your clipboard content, select tags from an Excel sheet, and write clipboard data to specific cells in the Excel file. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate these tasks.

### Important! The target excel file should not be opened in any application when this application is running; Data will not be saved to target excel file if it is opened before this application is closed.

• Configuration
The application requires a configuration file named `config.json` which should be placed in the same directory as the application. This configuration file contains necessary information about the Excel file and the sheets to interact with.

• Configuring `config.json`
The `config.json` file should be structured as follows:

```json
{
    "filename": "target.xlsx",
    "sheets_info": [
        ["CreditCard", "A", "B"],
        ["Bank", "E", "F"],
		["Mortgage","C", "F"]
    ],
    "sheet_color": {
        "CreditCard": "red",
        "Bank": "green",
		"Mortgage": "blue"
    },
    "markup_pairs": ["*", "*"]
}

```
